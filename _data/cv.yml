    - title: PhD
      institution: Sorbonne Université - Paris 6 / EDITE
      year: 2022
      description:
        - Generic programming in modern C++ for Image Processing
        - title: Taxonomy of different families of Image processing Algorithms / types
          contents:
            - Design of a Concept (C++20) framework for an Image processing library
            - Goal is to conciliate Genericity, efficiency and ease of use.
        - title: Application of the notions of views (inspired from Milena's morphers and STL's range views) to Image processing
          contents:
            - Usage of previously defined concept framework
            - Well-defined semantic for writability and data ownership, designed for performance (compiler's vectorisation)
            - New abstraction layer so that Image processing pipelines can be written in term of image instead of in term of pixel.
