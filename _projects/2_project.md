<a href="https://github.com/dutiona/blackmagic" title="blackmagic">Blackmagic</a> is a metaprogramming library inspired
by boost.hana. It provides facilities to build & check concepts, operate on tuples, type list, and do monadic functional
programming with lambdas (curry, partial application, etc.)
