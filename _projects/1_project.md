<a href="https://gitlab.lrde.epita.fr/olena/pylene" title="Pylene's gitlab">Pylene</a> is a fork of Milena, an image processing
library targeting genericity and efficiency. It provided mostly Mathematical Morphology building blocs for image
processing pipelines. The library has the following objectives in mind:
<ul>
    <li>Simplicity: both python bindings and simple C++ syntax</li>
    <li>Efficiency: write algorithms in a simple way and run them as if they were written in C. We follow one guideline: zero-cost abstraction.</li>
    <li>Genericity: write algorithms that are able to run on many kind of images with, yet, zero-cost abstraction.</li>
    <li>Interopability: run pylene algorithms on image coming from external libraries (even on your own image type).</li>
</ul>
