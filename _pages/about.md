Hello folks, welcome on my personal webpage. I am Michaël, a postdoctoral researcher at LRE in France. My researches are about Theoretical Computer Sciences applied to Image Processing. During my Ph.D. I have researched how to design a complete Concept framework for the image processing area. I provide this framework through the C++ [Pylene library](https://dutiona.github.io/projects/1_project/). I now research how we can provide an interface between the static world (C++ generic code) to the dynamic world (Python), which is where most of the Image processing community reside. I will explore several avenues, such as doing JIT compilation via different tools to provide optimal python bindings on-the-fly when requested by the practitioner.

On a personal note, I am active on reddit ([r/cpp](https://reddit.com/r/cpp)) and twitter. I like to read good books, travel and see interesting places, good (french) food and good music, such as Pink Floyd, Ramstein, etc.
